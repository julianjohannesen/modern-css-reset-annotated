# A modern CSS reset annotated

This project is a fork of Andy Bell's Modern CSS Reset. Modern CSS Reset is a tiny little reset that you can use as the basis of your CSS projects. You can read [Andy's breakdown on his site here](https://hankchizljaw.com/wrote/a-modern-css-reset/).

## Why fork the original project?

1. To provide additional information on CSS resets for those unfamiliar with them and to do that inline via comments in the source file

2. To provide a quick reference that more experienced users can refer to to refresh themselves as to why a certain property has a certain value

3. To provide citations that are both authoratative and **recent**

## Installation

First, clone this repository:

```console
git clone https://github.com/julianjohannesen/modern-css-reset-annotated.git
```

Then, go to `modern-css-reset-annotated` directory:

```console
cd modern-css-reset-annotated
```

And now, you can minify and move the main reset to the `dist` by running:

```console
npm run build
```

That's it! ðŸŽ‰
